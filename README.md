# 💊 Drug Effectiveness Analysis using Patient Feedback
## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes patient feedback and sentiment to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs prescribed for specific medical conditions.
By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and statistical modeling, the pipeline identifies trends in drug performance and patient satisfaction based on real-world reviews.

The goal is to help healthcare providers, pharmaceutical researchers, and regulators derive data-driven insights into how different drugs perform in real-world scenarios.
