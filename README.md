# 💊 Drug Effectiveness Analysis using Patient Feedback
## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes **patient feedback and sentiment** to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs prescribed for specific medical conditions.
By combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis**, and **statistical modeling**, the pipeline identifies trends in drug performance and patient satisfaction based on real-world reviews.

The goal is to help healthcare providers, pharmaceutical researchers, and regulators **derive data-driven** insights into how different drugs perform in real-world scenarios.
## 🎯 Business Problem

Pharmaceutical companies and health data analysts often rely on clinical trials to evaluate drug performance — but these trials don’t always reflect real-world patient experiences.
This project bridges that gap by analyzing **textual feedback** from patients (e.g., online reviews, surveys) to:

- Identify top-performing drugs based on sentiment and ratings.

- Detect side effects and recurring patient complaints.

- Evaluate overall treatment effectiveness by condition and demographic.
